## Improvements and Footnotes

This section details changes that would've been done if this were a fully fledged Production application. These improvements were not implemented in interest of conserving the time and scope for this project however I'd like to highlight a number of additions that I would've made.

- `UrlList.tsx` contains table rendering that could be split into a geneic Component. would have been split into a generic `Table` or `List` component that handled all the rendering logic for a parameterized number of columns and rows. This would enable a generic styled Table for the entire application.

- The API return type `Url` in hardcoded as an interface in the front end. In a live application, this would better be generated using the apollo-client via a schema generated by the back end.
